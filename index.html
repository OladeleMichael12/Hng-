            <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
            <p>
                Over the next two years, I aim to achieve significant milestones in my journey as a web developer. First and foremost, I plan to master the core front-end technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. To accomplish this, I will complete ten projects that showcase various aspects of front-end development, such as responsive design, animations, and interactivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to mastering the basics, I intend to gain expertise in a popular front-end framework like React.js or Vue.js. I will build five complex applications using the chosen framework, contribute to open-source projects, and complete a comprehensive course or certification to solidify my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expanding my skills to back-end development is also a priority. I will become proficient in a back-end language such as Node.js, Python, or Ruby. This goal will be achieved by completing three full-stack projects where I handle both front-end and back-end development and obtaining a relevant certification. Furthermore, I will deepen my understanding of databases by designing and implementing five projects that utilize SQL and NoSQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improving my workflow and tooling is essential for efficiency. I aim to become proficient in using Git and GitHub by regularly employing these tools in all my projects and contributing to ten open-source projects. Additionally, I will learn advanced Git features to enhance my version control skills. Understanding the basics of DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is another goal. I will set up a CI/CD pipeline for at least two projects using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enhancing my problem-solving skills is crucial for my development as a web developer. I plan to solve one hundred problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal to improve my algorithm and data structure knowledge. Building a personal brand is also important to me. I will establish myself as an authority in web development by writing twelve blog posts, creating a portfolio website, and presenting at two local meetups or conferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Networking and community involvement are key components of my professional growth. I aim to grow my professional network by joining three professional groups or online communities, attending five conferences or webinars, and actively participating in discussions. Additionally, I plan to develop and launch at least three personal projects, deploying them on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contributing to open-source projects is another goal. I will make meaningful contributions to three projects on GitHub that interest me, contribute regularly, and get at least one pull request merged. Finally, I will stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development by allocating five hours a week to continuous learning, following industry blogs, and taking online courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or freeCodeCamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                By setting and working towards these goals, I am confident that I will make significant strides in my career as a web developer over the next two years.
